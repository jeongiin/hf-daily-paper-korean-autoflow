However, LRMs typically suffer from\\n\"overthinking\" problems, where models generate significantly redundant\\nreasoning steps while bringing limited performance gains. Existing work relies\\non fine-tuning to mitigate overthinking, which requires additional data,\\nunconventional training setups, risky safety misalignment, and poor\\ngeneralization.\\n  Through empirical analysis, we reveal an important characteristic of LRM\\nbehaviors that placing external CoTs generated by smaller models between the\\nthinking token (<think> and </think>) can effectively\\nmanipulate the model to generate fewer thoughts. Building on these insights, we\\npropose a simple yet efficient pipeline, ThoughtMani, to enable LRMs to bypass\\nunnecessary intermediate steps and reduce computational costs significantly.
